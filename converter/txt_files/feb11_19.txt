- x axis of regression plot is seconds since transfer date

what I need to figure out: How to make my code run automatically when a patients data
moves from live to historical, i.e. when the fact they are discharged shows up in patient_info??

things i learned: sql triggers are a way to make sql code trigger whenever there is a modification to a table,
but making it run a python script might not be possible

running the script on a server, whether a local server or an online one using something like pythonanywhere.com 
or AWS or something like that may be possible, but probably isnt too efficient and also needs more investigation.
The script would be checking the table for changes every x seconds/minutes

could see if we can send ben our code to make

bens code(python script) is constantly running in an infinite loop on the jhbox, will only update the server if there is a difference 



todos: 

- Work on the python script to make it run on only newly entered data
- Meet with Ben and Dante at same time to discuss getting everything together
