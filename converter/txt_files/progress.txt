        list of ambulation objects
        total # of ambulations 
        
        max. amb. distance
        mean. amb. distance
        min amb. distance

        max amb. duration
        mean amb. duration
        min amb. duration

        max amb. speed
        mean amb. speed
        min amb. speed

        average # of ambulations/day 
        
    Don't have necessary info (I think):
        BN - Badge Number 
        Admission Date 
        Transfer date 
        Discharge Date 
        Length of Stay(TD-DD) 

    Haven't done yet:
        change in amb. distance over time
        change in amb. duration over time
        change in amb. speed over time

        fix these:
        compliance with 1/day  (I think?) <-- did it wrong!
        compliance with 2/day  (I think?) <-- did it wrong!
        compliance with 3/day  (I think?) <-- did it wrong!

    Might not have necessary info?
        Time on unit -> can't do this yet since we don't have time on unit yet.
